# REGISTRY_NAME Registration Requests

This repository's issues list manages requests to add and change entries in the [REGISTRY_NAME](REGISTRY_LINK). Please note our [contribution terms](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Your [Expert](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8126#section-4.6) is currently [EXPERT_GITHUB_ID](EXPERT_GITHUB_LINK).

To request registration of a REGISTRY_VALUE_NAME (or a change to an existing one), you can:

* [File an issue](https://github.com/protocol-registries/REPO_NAME/issues/new/choose) (preferred), or
* Send e-mail to [the mailing list](MAILING_LIST_LINK).

See [RFC_NUMBER](RFC_LINK) for more information; in particular, the [requirements for registration](RFC_REQUIREMENTS_LINK).

Once approved, your request will be incorporated into the IANA registry, whereupon it will be officially registered.
